All of our monitoring and metrics at Scribd are configured in Datadog, so it was important to have a mechanism to track changes across all these resources and be able to revert back to a previous state in case of a bad change. We also wanted the ability to search and edit across all dashboards and monitors (to refactor a tag, for example).",
