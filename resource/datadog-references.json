How would we know that it had changed? All of our monitoring and metrics at Scribd are configured in Datadog, so it was important to have a mechanism to track changes across all these resources and be able to revert back to a previous state in case of a bad change. We also wanted the ability to search and edit across all dashboards and monitors (to refactor a tag, for example).","title":"Backing up Datadog and Performing Bulk Edits | Scribd Technology","auth":"Jim Park","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/mobile/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/mobile/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/mobile/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/dashboards/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/dashboards/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/dashboards/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://www.datadoghq.com/product/platform/dashboards/","descrip":"Real-Time Interactive Dashboards | Datadog","title":"Real-Time Interactive Dashboards | Datadog","auth":"","date":0},{"url":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/summary-graphs-metric-graphs-101/","descrip":"Metric Graphs 101: Summary Graphs | Datadog","title":"Metric Graphs 101: Summary Graphs | Datadog","auth":"","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/widgets/timeseries/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/widgets/timeseries/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/widgets/timeseries/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/smoothing/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/smoothing/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/smoothing/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/beta/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/beta/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/beta/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/rollup/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/rollup/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/rollup/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/hostmap/","descrip":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/hostmap/","title":"https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/hostmap/","auth":"unknown","date":0},{"url":"https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/1256","descrip":"I try to extend my own datadog php interface with async events over dd-agent.
