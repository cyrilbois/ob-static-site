<p>This is a specific article about testing for accessibility.  Please see other articles on this site for other aspects of testing, easily accessed via <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/testing-epic#">testing-epic</a>.   In my experience, directors are less interested in funding the work-time to do accessibility testing unless they are targeting sales to a broad end-user market (literally, they do not think there will be any outcomes from that time and money spent).   Personally, I think it is a hygiene factor that should be automated as much as possible.  Thus the following tools...<br />
<i>Note ~ unlike other types of testing, lack of accessibility can have legal impacts. </i></p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Technical definition <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
A very common blog tactic is to define many words.  In this case “what should accessibility tests cover” is critical for compliance, and seems to be “implement the WCAG specs”, there are several releases to this.   There are three grades of strictness for compliance: “A”, “AA” and “AAA” <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, although no-one has defined the term, I assume the A is short for accessibility.  Requirements for these levels are discussed in <sup><a href="https://www.allaccessible.org/wcag-level-a-aa-and-aaa-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.<br />
Matching the rest of W3C publications, they have numbered edition labels, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a> released 2008, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">WCAG 2.1</a> released 2018 and a draft WCAG 2.2 published Sept 2022.  Newer versions are more relevant to modern problems, I'm entirely ignoring WCAG1, but I think everyone else does also.   The WCAG defines four design principals, to show their document is complete.  A website should be: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust [US english, but it works]; which roughly maps to each of the functional activities that a human needs to do to read something inside a data system.   The US government uses a slight simplification <sup><a href="https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.   To read more about specific fonts, please read <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/readable-fonts#">readable-fonts</a>.<br />
 <p>Boring sidebar: I added a HTML strictness tag to my boring website in 2010, as I was trying to show that I was using HTML correctly.  I think semantic HTML is a valuable non-functional objective, as it makes it easier to use the HTML for any other work.   Wordpress doesn't make this claim, we are different dev teams.   Between Q4 2022 and Q2 2023 I redeveloped up-to site template v4; I have verified and updated all accessibility compliance for today, I need to update the compliance tag.  I am now thinking I should remove the HTML correctness and WCAG tag from the non-index pages as its not globally relevant.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > What are the EU legal requirements? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>After June 2022, EU states must enshrine European Accessibility Act aka “EAA”, which covers access to services be it Cashpoints, taxis, sports on your phone or a random e-comnmerce website/ app.  Quoting <sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/05/11/the-european-accessibility-act-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> “The EAA was derived from the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).&quot;, the UNCRPD can be accessed as <sup><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1138&amp;amp;langId=en" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.   The full text for EAA can be accessed via <sup><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202" target="_blank">7</a></sup> and replaces the older Web Accessibility Directive aka WAD <sup><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102&amp;amp;from=EN" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.   There is an official cover page <sup><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/web-accessibility" target="_blank">9</a></sup> with access to translations and summaries.   Similar cover page for WAD <sup><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/web-accessibility-directive-standards-and-harmonisation" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.   The EU states this may incur a transition cost, but it is beneficial as: you have a broader market including 135 million disabled or old people in the EU which is about 30%; the single standard makes cross EU state trade easier and faster; in future lower operational costs.  Wiki claim EAA is in effect from 2019 <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Accessibility_Act" target="_blank">11</a></sup>, but it is a large scale process to apply to the whole of Europe.   Another acronym is European Harmonized Accessibility Standards aka EHAS <sup><a href="https://accessibility.civicactions.com/guide/glossary" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EN_301_549" target="_blank">13</a></sup> but this seems to be officialese for supporting WCAG.    <br />
From the perspective of webapps, supporting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines aka WCAG spec <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">15</a></sup> is a strong step to being correct for EEA.   The second link is a detailed breakdown of suggested behaviours.   As EEA is still being rolled out across EU states, and being defined in practical terms, the best practice is still being defined.   It is nice when W3C can agree with EU governance. Some more targeted notes are <a href="https://media-and-learning.eu/type/featured-articles/what-you-really-need-to-know-about-eu-accessibility-legislation/" target="_blank">EU vs US</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/" target="_blank">targeting older users</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/" target="_blank">accessible design</a>.<br />
Note ~ the EAA has a carve-out for tiny organisations of less than €2M/Y or less than 10 staff; so can ignore EAA if needed.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > What are the UK legal requirements in 2023?  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I'm expecting there will be a cascade of changes as a side effect of the politicians not needing to follow the EU.  <br />
In the UK, the legal requirements are the UK Equality Act aka UEA <sup><a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/guides/uk-equality-act/" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-disability-action-plan-confirmed-for-2023-as-minister-meets-paralympians-and-opens-pioneering-lab-at-olympic-park" target="_blank">17</a></sup>.  Concurrently the Equality Act 2010 <sup><a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/check-what-type-of-discrimination-youve-experienced/duty-to-make-reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-people/" target="_blank">18</a></sup> or the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) <sup><a href="https://codemantra.com/digital-accessibility-laws-uk/" target="_blank">19</a></sup> is quoted as still being in-effect.  Some guidance rather than laws is published as <sup><a href="https://userway.org/blog/uk-accessibility-laws/" target="_blank">20</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction" target="_blank">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/publishing-accessible-documents" target="_blank">22</a></sup><br />
Similar to the EAA, the UEA maps WCAG guidance.  I would guess that the same benefits apply to the UK implementation of WCAG, although the number of disabled / elderly would be smaller.  I see a quote of 20% with at least 1 limitation in several places (in previous links).   <br />
There are many documents on creating accessible content inside the gov.uk structure, for example <sup><a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2023/01/06/a-new-accessibility-strategy-for-the-gov-uk-design-system/" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps" target="_blank">24</a></sup> but that is off topic.</p>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > Practical solutions for testing accessibility  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>It is not practical to make an accessibility QA service for yourself.  The following rentable services exist:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Primary suggestions:</li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev" target="_blank">Pagespeed</a> ~ a free page checker from google; it runs in “mostly real-time” (i.e. each page report takes 15-20s).  It supports a good range of WCAG, but I'm not sure if it is 100% of it.   If you use Analytics, it will merge in the results.  It will show you a screen-grab of what each device looks like (from a chrome headless instance).  This is the option I currently use.  Quite a few features from this tool are available in Chrome as the “lighthouse” tab locally; and according to <sup><a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-automate-pagespeed-insights-for-multiple-urls-using-google-sheets" target="_blank">1</a></sup> there is a version that can be run on all URLs in your site at the same time.  A benefit of server based test tools that are not running on your local webserver, is that site performance can be measured; this is something that Pagespeed does well.</li>
    <li class="libasic">aXe acquired from <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank">git</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core" target="_blank">npm</a> can be linked into standard unit tests.  There is a paid service that performs all the manual vetting available from <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank">Deque</a> in addition.   If you had linked this to your test infra, the results would be very convenient.   They say they need a custom test URL, which duplicates the normal page, and links the additional aXe library.  For render-once sites like blogs, 1 test harness would cover the entire page; but for SPA with locally generated content aXe will need to be triggered after every “human input event” as the DOM will have been changed.  They state they have some capacity for JSDOM, running from NodeJS, but its not as reliable.</li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://tenon.io/" target="_blank">Tenon</a> is an API based service, and seems to mostly focus on HTML.  It has spider capacity; it strongly dislikes developers using A elements as buttons.   I saw no CSS issues via this, possibly as it wants to do staged processing.   Please see <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/" target="_blank">level access</a> as they bought Tenon.</li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://www.qualitylogic.com/testing-solutions/wcag-compliance-testing-certification/" target="_blank">QualityLogic</a> ~ a rentable service operated by visually impaired software engineers.   If they do revisions rather than just testing, they will need a while per client.  They do not quote a price in a place I can find.  This is a very US centric.</li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://softwaretesthelp.com/Visit-QASource" target="_blank">QASource</a> ~ rentable service, uses some manual testing, but mostly ML and AL to test.  They directly claim that every client is different, and so cannot give general quotes. This is a very US centric.</li>
    <li class="libasic">If you a looking at a template/comp/wireframe, using Visbug <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/visbug/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=search" target="_blank">FireFox</a> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/visbug/cdockenadnadldjbbgcallicgledbeoc/" target="_blank">chrome</a> is a nice dev experience <sup><a href="https://web.dev/testing-web-design-color-contrast/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  It doesn't test your site, it gives you a good look at your current design so you can edit it now (this includes editing-tools).  </li>
    <li class="libasic">Less targeted tools:</li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/" target="_blank">WAVE</a> ~ a client side only testing browser plugin, run by webAIM.    Running since 2001 from the Utah state University; much of this tools marketing is targeting older web trends.  Note as a browser plugin this can be run inside firewalls or security hobbles, so it is worth remembering as a backup test tool.   <strong>UPDATE</strong> I tried installing this, it does give reports, but it is very hard to work out which HTML element it is complaining about.  Also it doesn't read the whole of the CSS, so some of the objections are are wrong.   Thirdly, it doesn't assume that people with limited vision could have adapted their entire machine to have a larger font-size <sup><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-increase-font-size-in-browser/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/change-the-default-font-in-your-browser" target="_blank">4</a></sup>; so every site has to do it for them separately (my font-sizes are <strong>relative</strong>, so if you have limited focusing ability you are still supported).   Fourthly, it reports elements which are <i>display:none</i> as being small/ poorly coloured.</li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS" target="_blank">JAWS</a> ~ this is an established text to speech tool that sits on-top of webpages, or ms Word etc; also supports Braille.  They currently have a  video talking about 20year history, I know this, as I met them doing my second degree.   This should be used for 1 user journey “supporting blind people, who are using common blind-support tooling” as it is the most widely used website reader AFAIK.</li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc" target="_blank">SiteImprove</a> ~ a service that crawls every 5days.  SiteImprove is a member of w3c.   I cannot find any pricing.  Platform also supports <i>Deutsche</i>. </li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://www.powermapper.com/products/sortsite/" target="_blank">SortSite</a> ~ this is a site test tool, not an accessibility tester, but it does check WCAG v2 and v2.1.   It has a whole site UI, so if you make each page separately this would save staff time to test, but the smallest licence is 100USD <sup><a href="https://www.powermapper.com/buy/all/sortsite/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.</li>
    <li class="libasic">The W3C hosts a very long list of accessibility checkers <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> including ones that are quite old.  I think many of these are rules systems, and no fees; but do not have a practical means to check.   If you use a Linux, you probably have <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/tidy.1.html" target="_blank">tidy</a>, which is a convenient <em>HTML validator</em>, and supports WCAG checks.  As a HTML validator, it doesn't look at CSS so this is only useful for some situations.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Boring sidebar: On my personal site, my PageSpeed scores are all over 95%; this should be achievable on most sites/platforms/apps.   The updates didn't cost very much, and can be done as a rolling process on each completed feature.  It is the law.  The UK government recommends making an accessibility statement <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.</li>
