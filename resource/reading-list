<p>This article is one of the few things that should be prefixed with “my”, like I am a North American.  These actually are “my books”.  I don't think this list is very interesting, but I thought I had to publish what I was doing instead of lectures (yes this whole thing does feel like a BTEC, but anyone can say “they do professional development” at interviews, with little supporting evidence).</p>

<p>Some of these books are a “book about use of X”, where I have never used X personally.  Our dev-team was thinking X tool may be useful, so one of us gets the book, and stuff online and finds out how use and abuse X.</p>

<p>My time for book reading is mostly my 40min morning commute to the office and my 40min commute back. I think books are generally written better than blogs, for understanding a process or system, rather than listing a procedure.  If I read less economics I would have done more text books.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> Recent reading <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h2>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">E. A. Meyer, E. Weyl [2017-11] “CSS ~ the definitive guide 4th ed” O'Reilly ~ This is too large to carry with you, or through airports etc.  Not completed this. I have completely read 2 of the 3 previous editions.</li>
    <li class="libasic">M. Casciaro, L. Mammino [2016-07] &quot;NodeJS Design Patterns”, Packt ~ I bought this to see if there is a big difference between JS and Java or PHP design patterns.  There isn't, aside from a few details on pointers/ references and global scope.</li>
    <li class="libasic">M. Hodges-Schell, J O'Brien [2015] “Communicating the UX Vision”, Morgan Kaufman</li>
    <li class="libasic">L. Kay [2017] “Researching UX: analytics”, sitepoint </li>
    <li class="libasic">K. Owen [2016] “the future UI/UX from the ground up” ESD cloud media ~ this is a paper copy of someones blog. I dislike this publication format, as the text density was too low, and they should have removed all the “pullout quotes”, as no one will pull out from a paper media.</li>
    <li class="libasic">D. Olsen [2015]  “the Lean Product playbook”, Wiley ~ this book needs 50% of the words removed, IMO, in an intelligent fashion,</li>
    <li class="libasic">Cooper, Reimanin, Cronin, Hoessel [2014] “About face, the essentials of interaction design” 4th ed, Wiley</li>
    <li class="libasic">R. Hartson, P. S. Pyla [2012] “The UX book” Morgan Kaufman </li>
    <li class="libasic">J. Kalbach [2009] “Mapping Experiences: A Guide to Creating Value through Journeys Blueprints and Diagrams (Paperback)&quot;, O'Reilly, book written by a professional communicator</li>
    <li class="libasic">O. Filipova [2016] “Learning Vue.js 2”, Packt </li>
    <li class="libasic">B. Labay, M. Sidoff, P Laja, A. Birket [2016-12] “Conversion focused UX guidelines for ecommerce” ConversionXL. ~ This is very UX, good for commercial practice.</li>
    <li class="libasic">S. Krug [2006] “Dont make me think” 2nd ed, New riders, digital</li>
    <li class="libasic">D. Eadline [2015-10] “Hadoop 2 quick start guide”, Addison Wesley ~ digital</li>
    <li class="libasic">D. Eadline, O. Mandelvich, C. Stella [2016-12] “Practical Data science with hadoop and spark”, Addison Wesley ~ digital</li>
    <li class="libasic">T. Butler [2017-08] “Nginx cookbook”, Packt</li>
    <li class="libasic">A. Bhargava, [2013-11] “Designing and implementing Test automation frameworks with QTP”, Packt ~ I am reading this as notes on design of tools are quite rare. QTP is a VB DSL, but I have no interest in notes on MSIE circa 2011-2012 when the guy was writing this.</li>
    <li class="libasic">J. Diakun, R. Johnson, D. Mock [2016-06] “Splunk operational intelligence cookbook, second edition” ~ this is Splunk 6.3, we are using 7.1</li>
    <li class="libasic">Sigman B. P. Degado E. [2016-09] “Splunk essentials 2nd Ed”, Packt</li>
    <li class="libasic">Mezzalira L. [2018-01] “Front-End Reactive Architectures: Explore the Future of Front end using Reactive Javascript Frameworks and Libraries”, Apress ~ quite strong with architecture/ design patterns</li>
    <li class="libasic">Burrows M. [2014] “Kanban from the inside”, Blue hole press ~ the current CTO bought some Kanban training, and a list of books. This was one of them.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Filipova O. [2017] “Vue.js 2 and bootstrap 4 web development”, Packt</li>
    <li class="libasic">Jakobus B., Marah J., Moreto S., Lambert M. [2017-07] “Bootstrap 4 responsive web design” Packt</li>
    <li class="libasic">Jakobus B. Marah J. [2018-02] “Mastering bootstrap 4”, Packt </li>
    <li class="libasic">Freeman, A. [2018-09] “Pro Vue.js 2” Apress ~ Book walked through a list of common design patterns and implemented them.  Author is clearly experienced in managing large texts.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Dorard L. [2014-08] “Bootstrapping Machine Learning: The first guide to Prediction APIs” CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. ~ This is business analysis of ML, and not very technical.  A good first book.  My current boss gave it too me, which maybe why its from 2014.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Shenoy, A. [2016-01] “Introducing Zurb Foundation 6”, Apress ~ Book felt at a higher level than the bootstrap ones</li>
    <li class="libasic">Agrawal A., Gans J., Goldfarb A. [2018] “Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence”, Harvard Business Review Press ~ I thought this was better than the above ML recipe book.  Maybe I am closer to the target audience.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Halliday P. [2018-03] “Vue.js 2 Design Patterns and Best Practices” Packt ~ Best book specifically on Vue that I have read yet.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Hanington B., Martin B. [??] “Universal methods of design” Rockport ~ although this talks about design, its much more focused on UX, IMO. I can't find a publication date.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Shute Z. [2019-01] “Advanced Javascript”, Packt ~ For people like me who just use another scripting language called JS, without any co-ordinated or formal study in it; this book is good.  This is working details on leaving JS1.5 (as in ECMA from 2010) for ES16.  Its faster to read this than to read the language spec three times (I read it twice, ES15 is more important).</li>
    <li class="libasic">Dondis D. A. [1974] “A Primer of Visual literacy” MIT press ~ communication theory book mostly, useful for how to represent things.  I read it as it mentions Koestler on the back. </li>
    <li class="libasic">Huff D [1991] “How to lie with statistics” Penguin.  This book belongs to my boss; if I wasn't me (with alot of previous stats), I would have learned more.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">Forsyth D. [2018] “Probability and Statistics for Computer Science” Springer.  Remedial maths at the start; but the end of the book is much better.  I still want a cheat sheet that defines equations using libm API names, rather than Greek letters.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Copes, F. [May 12, 2020] “The Deno Handbook: a concise introduction to Deno 🦕&quot; ~ this is “concise” at 100+ pages, also with a UTF-8 in the title.  Stylistically, this is a more of a <strong>very long blog</strong> article.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Wong, W T [2019] “Advanced elastic search 7.0” Packt. This book does do what it says on the back cover; however to me this shouldn't mention “advanced”. Thirty plus pages of screenshots on use of Postman is first year undergrad stuff.</li>
    <li class="libasic">S. Singh, P. Singh [2021] “Hand on Go programming, learn google golang programming data structures error-handling and ...&quot; BPB Publications.   I went through quite a few golang books; trying to get a recent one.   Golang is an evolving language, old texts will have old solutions.</li>
    <li class="libasic">D. Vanderkam [2020] “Effective typescript, 62 specific ways to improve your typescript” O'Reilly.   This is not “Your first programming book”, I just wanted “these are the specific things about typescript that you ought to know” book.</li>
    <li class="libasic">S. Bradley [2021] “Design patterns on Typescript”  </li>
    <li class="libasic">F. Trottier-Hebert [Jun 2015] “Learn you some Erlang” <a class="cleanimage" href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com" target="_blank">https://learnyousomeerlang.com</a>  I was reading this on the train in 2019.  I think its useful to see FP from an architectural perspective that is less manic about Javascript. Data pipelines are frequently written in FP.  There is no JS in this book [aside from powering the syntax highlighting].  I didn't add this earlier as its a website that hold book content.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2018, some of 2019, I have been AI journal papers from Nature, but these aren't a focus for me. <br />
I have read three books on bootstrap in 2019, so I am 'more balanced' in tool awareness. For new projects that I am leading, I still prefer Foundation, as it has better abstraction. <br />
UPDATE: Jan 2020 - July 2020, due to CoVid19 restrictions, I have been reading my backlog of art books; which I previously had just accumulated.</p>
