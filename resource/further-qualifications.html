<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> Intro  <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>One of the reason I wanted to move closer to London is make further training more practical.  There is a greater concentration of resources in London, than most of the UK.</p>

<p>Firstly let me state:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Maintenance qualifications to ensure you have not forgotten anything are a good idea.</li>
    <li class="libasic">As IT keeps moving, qualifications to encourage learning new systems are a good idea.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Utilisation of standard frameworks is a good idea.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I like to separate myself from some categories of web-page-maker, as I note their coding style is entirely different to mine.  New qualifications should support this.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I wrote this before the exam.  My opinions on multiple choice exams are common across people in “learning” rather than “qualifications” or “examination”.</li>
    <li class="libasic">PHP is running on about 75% of the web, says a <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all" target="_blank">survey</a> <sup><a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/programming_language" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://php.net/usage.php" target="_blank">2</a></sup> [1].  I think there are alot of sites that don't report this type of information, but if you look at the method the surveyors used, its quite a good guess.   A larger percentage of <a href="http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/fact_20130813" target="_blank">Russian sites</a> are using PHP.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I note that Perl has no qualifications really.  There have been a list of attempts, but the greater community squashed them <sup><a href="http://www.perlcert.com/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> My concerns on ZCE are [2] <a href="#toc1"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Some of the courses cost about the same as a my MSc.  My MSc is administered by a unit of part of an international meta-organisation which supports, endorses and partially invented critical reading and peer review.  Universities as a group have a thousand year history.   The college of my first degree has a long and prestigious history.  I could start a “IT skills course” with “web design” units, and sign people to be good at making websites.  If I did after the completion of iceline, they could produce quite reasonable sites quite fast.  Other than a software engineer, who am I?</li>
    <li class="libasic">The published book by Zend contains spelling errors.  If that was my CV I wouldn't be hired.</li>
    <li class="libasic">From an industry perspective, the ZF1 qualification is ancient.  Things in IT move fast; I don't think I have ever used ZF1.  Thus I have no wish to pay for a ZF1 exam.  At the appropriate points, I can present you ZF2 code, which I wrote.  I hope that is what you would hire me for.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Questions that ask <em>“tell me what I'm thinking”</em> are easy to write, and quite stupid.  Multiple choice questions encourage this.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Practical subjects are best done by creation of artefacts, like <a href="http://codility.com/" target="_blank">c0d1l1ty</a> (which I have passed).  I understand the ZF and ZF2 units are more practical qualifications.</li>
    <li class="libasic">  </li>
    <li class="libasic">After reading the published Zend book, as a counter note; I do value the observation that the section of questions is mostly a psychology test.  This is likely to catch people too nervous to think or are guessing.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Positive credit for due diligence on PHP version locking.</li>
    <li class="libasic">If I can pass this without effort, its a waste of money; if I fail first, its important.  I had the same problem with my GCSEs.</li>
    <li class="libasic">As a certificate in web architectures, rather than software engineering, it is a valuable study.  I am a software engineer.  As the people running Zend wrote a large part of the current PHP interpreter, them managing the qualification about it makes sense.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> Future plans <a href="#toc2"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>I value examination as an externally regulated statement of ability.  I can say I'm really good, but how does one substantiate this?  I wear suits more than many developers, but I don't want to be a position where technical ability is judged by clothes.</p>

<p>Updated: I passed the exam, see <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages#show-ClientCandidateID=ZEND022735" target="_blank">here</a>.  Apparently I am in the vicinity being the 10,000 person with one of these <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zend_Technologies#Zend_Certification_Test" target="_blank">4</a></sup> on the planet (figures from second half 2013, when I got this).   These are professional maintenance qualifications, to demonstrate currency.  I do thank my employer for favouring and endorsing quality in operational process.  These exams should not be taken like driving licences (where you are prohibited from driving before you have one).  I have written lots of code; the exam is a marker that people outside of IT may understand.  For people inside IT, I just show them some source that I wrote recently.</p>

<p>As a due diligence measure, I will cover several Perl tests.  I won't particularly mention this later on, but I do note there is alot of the “stuff in CPAN” it would be useful if I knew about, e.g. “Perl as a platform”.  In the last few months, my handling of complex structures inside Perl has improved.</p>

<p>There is a long delay while Zend the corporation writes the ZF2 exam.  I have used ZF2 alot more than ZF1.  As such spending large large amounts of money on a out of date qualification is abit pointless.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with my current employer, but I am looking at a <a href="http://trainings.sensiolabs.com/en/training/symfony-certification" target="_blank">Symfony cert</a>.  I use MVC, I have degrees emphasising MVC, I build large structures, which are MVC. I would need to concentrate <em>not to write as MVC</em>; separation of responsibility means you wind up making MVC again.  But as a tickable box for HR people, I don't have it.  Symfony2 having a different release cycle, have already published their courses.<br />
There are short courses at the BCS which look interesting, as they cover gaps in what I am certified in.<br />
I am also thinking about a <a href="http://www.reed.co.uk/courses/prince2" target="_blank">Prince2</a> qualification, to broaden the PM aspect.<br />
There is another platform popular in contracting called “expression engine”, this has some <a href="http://www.train-ee.com/" target="_blank">qualifications</a>, which I will invest in, in the future.  I also found <a href="http://traintelco.com/index.php/tutorials-and-guides/item/php/up-and-running-with-php-codeigniter.html" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
