<p>This is the most “senior engineer article” on this site to-date.   <b>Expected audience:</b> software engineers who have clients/ bosses in the UK.   This article is quite long.</p>

<p>The current Tory administration is working to improve the currency and relevancy of UK law regarding “dem interweb finngies”.   A longer version of this text would reference the educational attainments of the people proposing the laws, and so a basic observation of their domain knowledge.   Some UK law is well written/ wise, e.g. the law regulating the public carrying of random things that seem to indicate pre-mediated violence, the current state <sup><a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/offensive-weapons-knives-bladed-and-pointed-articles" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, but my initial statement was thinking about the 1950s edition <sup><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/14/2023-02-07" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.   This is a factual article, I will edit until this is as objective as other text on this site.<br />
Note <i>con sottovoci</i>, an actual Tory MP, in Parliament (their place of work) claimed they used “dem interwebs finngies” so badly, whilst they where looking for notes about Tractors for an Agricultural proposal, they accidentally mis-tapped and looked at pron for a while, got called up for it; then did the same thing again <sup><a href="https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/uk-news/tractorgate-mp-stand-down-after-26840254" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-tory-neil-parish-quits-26839237" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  I do not look at pron at work (or otherwise), I work hard instead. <br />
   <br />
Domain jargon: work-in-progress is called a <b>bill</b>, a completed piece is called an <b>act</b> <sup><a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/publications/bills-acts/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.   The initial step / call to arms / plan is called a <b>white paper</b>.   I believe the two later steps are published on different coloured paper.   Unelected and unaccountable 'Think tanks' ~ which are not part of the government ~ also make white papers.  The <b>CPS</b> is the Crown Prosecution Service <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service" target="_blank">6</a></sup>, the organisation that enforces criminal law in the UK, other countries have “public prosecutors” instead.   As a smaller thing than an Act, there are “UK Statutory Instruments”.  These have narrower activity scope and often narrower in terms of geography.  This text list Acts, rather than SI.  The <b>UKG</b> is my abbreviation for “united kingdom government” whilst being vague about which one.  Whats “pron”?  Its a spoonerism, there is at least 1 really stupid content filter that fails to know that “talking about X without showing it” is not the same as “here is lots of X”, please read <sup><a href="https://html.com/blog/websites-britain-blocked/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/verhuetung-erst-ab-18-deutschlands-wichtigster-jugendschutz-filter-blockiert-hilfsangebote/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> ~ second link is from DE, but same limited tech same applies, <i>NOTE: this article is about UK laws, its perfectly child-safe and has no pictures/videos at all.</i></p>

<p>I am adding this section, as I previously worked for a new startup, who, when they made their first edition sales funnel which was quite bland, was blocked.  The first version of the website text was made by a UK barrister, as this startup was his sidejob.   Barristers are obviously precise with wording.   My ISP which is on default settings, described it as pron.   As far as I know that domain had never previously be registered by other organisations.   So ISPs “intelligent blocking”, is actually “new domain blocking”, which is easier, but not very smart.</p>

<div class="lotsOfWords">
<p>The activity list for a new company site is:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Buy and setup domain, </li>

</ul>

<p>To be able to see if your website is currently being blocked, view the <a href="https://www.blocked.org.uk/" target="_blank">open rights group checker</a>.  In the UK, being blocked here, will limit 3.5 million households and many mobile connections from being able to view your legitimate business.  </p>
<p>There are 10 major ISPs serving the UK <sup><a href="https://www.techradar.com/broadband/which-are-the-most-popular-internet-service-providers-in-the-uk" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/providers/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> (noting 'relabel brands' grow quickly).

<p>This paragraph is limited to “normal” non-controversial business' the UK, and is current to early 2024.  It probably won't change radically in the near future, but note the current rate of law publications.    This is a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">well known sites</a> that have been blocked in the UK.   The reason for blocking makes the process look quite manual, also another example <sup><a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2022/11/24/incident-report-some-gov-uk-urls-blocked-by-deceptive-site-warning/" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.   <br />
The list of default blocking by UK ISPs is <sup><a href="https://www.blocked.org.uk/stats/probes" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.   There has been fairly organised work by Studios, to block access to major pirate sites <sup><a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/10/six-big-uk-isps-ordered-to-block-five-piracy-streaming-websites.html" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.<br />
Whilst building the list of ISPs, I got this list of tools, which claim to validate resources used by your website</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://dnschecker.org/" target="_blank">DNS checker</a></li>
    <li class="libasic"><a href="https://www.urlvoid.com/" target="_blank">URL void</a></li>

<p>Assuming your site is virtuous, not being filtered by Google's <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/" target="_blank">safebrowsing API</a> is wise, the webmaster side notes for this are <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/security/malware?hl=en&amp;amp;" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.</p>
