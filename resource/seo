<p>note: The first edition on this was written in Sept 2015, Penguin and Panda where at the  start of the year.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> General notes <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>It is more honest to call SEO one of the following “letting tech people not use crap tech” or “content librarianship”.  Any good search engine will return content that the user requested.  Users want content, not vague marketing pitches.   A good traditional librarian will ensure that all the books are present, that they are in good condition, and they are the current edition, that they are in the expected location on the shelves.  Lastly that the books are books worth reading.  Applying these same rules or conditions to websites makes them much more useful.</p>

<p>There are many websites which mostly contain marketing whoffle.  Marketeers hyping to other marketeers is even worse, its incredibly vague, emotive and suggestive <sup><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/does-my-content-suck/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.searchdecoder.com/wordpress-design-engagement/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://seo-hacker.com/5-reasons-why-people-bite-on-linkbaits/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://blog.influenceandco.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-captivating-content" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://adespresso.com/academy/blog/why-your-facebook-ads-shouldnt-be-blue/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.  For comparison developers hand out tools and libraries that others may use.   The most valuable libraries automate things that you need to do really often, that are annoying, banal and dull (e.g. GIT).</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> what do I mean by “vague and suggestive”? <a href="#toc1"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I accept the fact that with information systems I am very boring, uncool; but I am fairly clear and structured.  <br />
Poor marketing is like the following made-up examples:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Model photo + “10 ways a washing machine improved my life in Sunny Spain &quot; (posted in a dull Feb in the UK, with a UK centric brand)<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">why: is quite vague about washing machines, and the article could equally be applied to any to the competitors, with a simple change in logo.  Therefore as the end user, how does help me choose a washing machine?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li class="libasic">Spending alot of effort on co-lateral to get people to confuse XXX washing machine with sports and “summer fun”<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">why: this breaks communication and language. As we very rarely talk about buying washing machines, we don't need lots of words to do this. This is short on facts.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li class="libasic">Sales co-lateral where the only fact is that you won a best of breed award.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">why: the current vendor was the only contender for that award.  Again, no facts.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p><i>“I don't buy washing machines, but when I do, I want actual numbers”</i> [apologies to that meme photo of an old guy in a pin stripe suit holding a beer].  <br />
In a metric that other people also use.  Without any funny distortion on number formats.  Just like your internal sales reports. <br />
I really cannot imagine buying a washing machine on a casual whim, or because you thought the sales person had a nice smile.  A non-vague and suggestive washing machine infomercial ~ due to subject, I suspect that an infomercial is best format ~ would:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">List details compared to public external metrics; like EU power efficiency ratings</li>
    <li class="libasic">Have up-to-date numbers for this washing machine and the competition; if this is a very wash-volume optimised machine, state this</li>
    <li class="libasic">Should describe the user interface, maybe via screenshots</li>
    <li class="libasic">If you have no actual USP, you will need to compete on price</li>
</ul>

<p>This is referencing items that people buy rarely, have low awareness of, and cannot be sold as “life style purchase”.  Items like this really need good marketing.<br />
Note last time I did buy a washing machine, one of the options had a special slot; so if you discovered a random sock after you had started a load, you could put the sock in that wash. This is innovative and a good USP.</p>

<p>Precise notes on SEO change all the time, but the big meta rule remains: make websites useful to users, and give them something that they want.  Contrary to what various marketeers think, most users are not burdened too much money that they are unsure how to get rid of.  <br />
One could write suggestions such as: ensure pages load quickly, ensure they look OK on a variety of machines, ensure work with intermittent net connection, ensure they work if you are colour blind.  [and so on.]  I think this list is quite obvious.  Basically users aren't sitting in front of a souped-up mac, with a second screen, and a 100MB net connection, in a decent office; they don't have your education, or good colour vision.  They are sitting on the tube, on the end of their battery, exchanging an argument via SMS with their partner; before a big meeting.  ...And also looking at your site.  If your site is still useful in the real world, then you are good at SEO ~ yes this is what search engines are trying to measure.  The previous sentence is focussed on use of the site, rather than discovery of the site; but the trip via google would need to work for any new visitors.  Google are more likely to return sites that are technically useful to users.</p>

<p>Marketing people have invented various pyramid schemes for popularity, described <sup><a href="https://designhammer.com/blog/17-black-hat-seo-techniques-avoid" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.  An example of a link trap tagged inside a google cache: <sup><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:c2mLl6vdBRYJ:www.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjaysondemers%2F2014%2F08%2F25%2Fthe-12-essential-elements-of-high-quality-content%2F%20&amp;amp;cd=5&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk" target="_blank">7</a></sup> (the forbes site is still live, but its annoying)</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> Goooles MO <a href="#toc2"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>Google inc is not the only place for information retrieval, but is is a highly prominent one.  The actual market is more tangled than niaf analysis would indicate, as Google inc supplies search services for other search engines. <br />
If you are not a marketeer, what Google say is generally common sense.  They want to serve end-users results that work, are relevant, are current, and are correct (in the sense that if you say you sell Mondeos, you actually sell them).   If you are a marketeer, Google are an elephant in the room, who keep changing the rules. Google keep blocking marketeers dragnets, as they weaken the search results.  Marketeers do things like making-up blogs, to fill with “link juice” <sup><a href="http://adpearance.com/blog/link-juice-explained-its-about-quality-not-quantity" target="_blank">8</a></sup> for their own brands primary site <sup><a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/07/15/how-to-find-and-drain-link-juice" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.  In less-marketeer-speak; link to the primary site, suggesting concepts about the primary site that may or may not be true.</p>

<p>About six months ago, Google released a few new editions of their search algorithm, the updates where called Penguin <sup><a href="http://provenrankings.com/in-the-aftermath-of-penguin-2-0-branding-is-now-a-huge-ranking-factor/" target="_blank">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-algorithm-changes-210285" target="_blank">11</a></sup> and Panda <sup><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-panda-penguin-realtime-218407" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-forecloses-on-content-farms-with-farmer-algorithm-update-66071" target="_blank">13</a></sup> respectively.  There many words written on marketing blogs about how this was going to disrupt many marketing schemes.  Marketeers had apparently prematurely optimised to a particular piece of technology <sup><a href="http://blog.woorank.com/2014/08/panda-penguin-a-guide-to-feared-googles-zoo/" target="_blank">14</a></sup>, and now needed to revert.  Marketeers where not impressed <sup><a href="http://seomelbourne.com/video/how-does-the-penguin-update-affect-your-content-strategy/" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.dotimpact.co.uk/everything-need-know-penguin-3-0/" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.marketing-mojo.com/infographic/website-affected-panda-penguin-updates/" target="_blank">17</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://blocmarketing.co.uk/blog/googles-penguin-updates-questions-answered/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc3"> Information retrieval.  <a href="#toc3"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>Information retrieval was the research focus of my first degree, I could see that this an important trend. This is not quite the same as SEO.  The rate of acquiring new information in computer systems increases every year. This is why we need good search tools.  SEO is part of “search”, as far as well-built systems are more searchable.  Search is more interesting to me, but not relevant to this article.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc4"> My site <a href="#toc4"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>This guy keeps talking about SEO, what is he doing (...article starts to plod)?</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">I have to many outbound links.  I will not try to trap users on my site, as I only expect tech literate people to want to read it; and these can't be trapped.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I am clearly writing articles on defined subjects <sup><a href="http://searchengineland.com/quality-content-factors-list-thats-actually-helpful-213796" target="_blank">19</a></sup>, not vague marketing hype.   These are subjects that I know about, not vague opinion pieces.</li>
    <li class="libasic">In theory I am linking back to my site on social media.</li>
    <li class="libasic">The data structure is in clear English (e.g. the URL space, and internal links etc).</li>
    <li class="libasic">The page content is the same if you don't read CSS or JS.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I have lots of meta data (e.g. the human language, article summaries, descriptions etc).</li>
    <li class="libasic">All the semantic tags are present, so parser may understand what the page is about.</li>
    <li class="libasic">The following are less important, can are done quite simply.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">Most ~ if not all ~ of my internal links are annotated.</li>
        <li class="libasic">As the markup is hand crafted, it is relatively small, and is readable. </li>
        <li class="libasic">My site is perfectly readable on phones, tablets or desktop.</li>
        <li class="libasic">I intend to build meta data caches, this can be used for high quality search, but I haven't had time.</li>
        <li class="libasic">Marketeers would have a mailing list <sup><a href="http://www.marketingdonut.co.uk/blog/2013/07/your-mailing-list-secret-maximising-your-roi" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.</li>
        <li class="libasic">I should engineer organic reach <sup><a href="http://blog.hootsuite.com/creative-ways-to-boost-your-facebook-organic-reach/" target="_blank">21</a></sup> via facebook as I am told this is where people get news from <sup><a href="http://fortune.com/2015/07/14/twitter-facebook-news-sources/" target="_blank">22</a></sup>, but I don't have the time, and I not sure its worth the effort.</li>
