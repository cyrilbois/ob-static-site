<p>The role covers April 2004 till Oct 2010.   Employed as a software engineer, I helped move a company from an ad-hoc software creation, to a structured development process.  The company was focused on the reseller market for internet bandwidth.  The company had an efficient sales force, and was awarded in a number of places, to quote the commercial directors linked-in profile “murphx was voted ISP of the Year at the Comms Business Awards 2009 and has been listed in Sunday Times Microsoft Tech Track 100, 2009, Deloitte Fast 50 and Deloitte Fast 500 EMEA as one of the fastest growing technology companies in the UK”.</p>

<p>Towards the end of this period, the telephony side of the company had been bought by Daisy plc, and is no longer a separate trading entity to the best of my knowledge.  After I left, the original development team, under the CTO was formed as new company ~ called murja ~ as a pure software services company.   This still seems to be a turbulent state, and that leaving at that point was a smart idea.   He seems to have closed company that in 2017.</p>

<p>As I was the fourth employee – and first software engineer – I used the following software engineering ideas to reduce risk.  By the time I left, the company had grown considerably :</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">

<h3 class="dontend" id="toc4"> Learning <a href="#toc4"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>This was my first real job.  When I joined I was very shy and in-secure. In hindsight, I would have behaved the way I do now for the whole period, but that is quite difficult.  <br />
I will talk about project management I was doing in this role at various points, which is the important bit of what I was doing at the end.   The work improved my project tracking and management skills.<br />
I gained lots of technical experience, but this wasn't an enterprise employer for the majority of its life.</p>
