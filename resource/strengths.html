<p>It might be over the top to post these lists on the internet, however having written this I will be better placed to answer this in interviews.  I believe in software creation as a process, and people like me as artisans and administrators of the living process.  You hire me and people like me as agents of change, not fixed assets.<br />
I have been told that what I presented on my CV makes me a very rounded person.  Previously I felt I was overly specialised in my activities, and tried to widen them.  Not as a “improve my CV” meme, but as a “improve myself”.  I like a range of different activities so I react to situations intelligently to avoid “when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail” <sup><a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/11/messages/223.html" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/10716" target="_blank">2</a></sup> being true.  I would love more time to read, to do art.</p>

<p>On writing this document, I notice I instinctively use several discrete domain specific languages.   I hope I have moderated it enough to be readable by the general public.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> Positive attributes. <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>I would emphasise these things as positive reasons to employ me ::</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">I am thorough, I have strong professional Ethics.  I try to make what I am doing a complete item, using complete <sup><a href="http://homepages.feis.herts.ac.uk/~comqejb/algspec/node11.html" target="_blank">3</a></sup> in the context of logic theorems.  I think this is a strength, as it increases reuse of work, and therefore reduces the TCO for development.  I favour objects as the mechanism for packaging responsibilities.  Planning on this scale is sensible as it encourages higher quality, as it is practical to create test harness etc.  As most engineers, I am honest; although try not to loose social smoothness due to this.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I work in the knowledge economy <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, and value learning opportunities as a business assets.   I have a fairly wide technical background, and am widely educated.  I have plenty of transferable skills.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I am a team-player; to quote theory, the most efficient network is closely-coupled decentralised network, with tightly defined responsibilities <sup><a href="http://www.ehornecker.de/Papers/IRIS-bittner.pdf" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/dan_dennett_on_dangerous_memes.html" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster" target="_blank">8</a></sup> .  As everyone is an individual, communication helps avoid undesirable characteristics.  Conversely I try to manage meetings to ensure they are steered and move towards goals.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I believe in Kaizen <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://world-class-manufacturing.com/Kaizen/kaizen.html" target="_blank">10</a></sup> and Agile development <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">11</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.  Software engineering has a long history of failure due to lack of tracking on customers actual requirements.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">I rarely “write software”, I try to “provide solutions”.  As I feel responsible for any post release problems, I attempt to detail processes and paperwork to minimise them.  “Features” <sup><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3410/software_engineering_is_not_.php" target="_blank">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_Driven_Development" target="_blank">14</a></sup> such as logging aren't optional, they allow to you to know, rather than guess what business system failed, and why.  To quote another catchphrase, “worse is better” <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/08/worse-is-better.html" target="_blank">17</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html" target="_blank">18</a></sup>, that is provide something now, below budget; so it can be adapted to the current reality.   In the same statement, I prefer the option to maintain good quality (as stated in the first point), so incremental release is focused on number of features and complexity rather than time spend on any singular feature.   Personally, solutions are found best found by referencing the requirements, rather than historical works. </li>
    <li class="libasic">As a reflection of human-managed heterogeneous networking <sup><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.49.3710&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">19</a></sup>, I am security aware, and am a defensive programmer.  I clean all my user input, and log carefully.   This does increase development costs, but complies to various legislation on customer data.  Defensive design from the start is a much cheaper way to manage the problem, than trying to bolt it into an existing system (see the evolution of the ms-windows code base from win3.1 through winXP as a clear example).  I try to use frameworks, so security may be applied to a known standard across the entire platform.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">I have strong graphical composition and design skills.   My personal design style (ever since year 9 GCSE coursework) is holistic and brand aware.  I am a good line artist, but rarely get time to do anything.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I strongly value the first five minutes to think, in terms of an asset, rather than enjoyment.  A slightly detached and analytical approach has demonstrated considerable value many times.   There is sometimes political persuasion required that note gathering is “higher value” working than starting typing instantly, but strategy before tactics.</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc1"> Negative attributes <a href="#toc1"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>I would admit to these failings ::</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">When I am tired, I am useless at English and all other human languages.   I can write code to a reasonable level, as coding languages are blunt and direct.   There are no nuances and not many synonyms in a good API.   I think I am worse at this than other people as I am minorly dyslexic.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">Because I am an adult, I work on this problem by scheduling when I write things to times when I'm not tired, using all available software tools, and regularly asking for proof readers.  English more that other other human languages encourages T.I.M.T.O.W.T.D.T - “there is more than one way to do it” <sup><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt" target="_blank">20</a></sup>, which means you need precision to use it correctly.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li class="libasic">I concentrate solely on what I'm doing.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">Because I am an adult, I work on this problem by spending the first 30mins of each day working out daily goals.  I actively engage with project managers.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li class="libasic">Before I commit to completing a solution, I “branch” and try-out many possible solutions.  Having made my mind up, I am inflexible.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">Because I am an adult, I write plenty of things down, which helps avoid information loss, and I try to get buy-in from any relevant parties (encouragement to choose the best available solution).  At this point single-mindedness will generate outcomes quickly.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li class="libasic">Due to the previous two points, I sometimes tend towards “depth first searches” - i.e. exhaustively evaluating a single interesting option before skipping between the initial concepts - which is time expensive.  In some situations, i.e. academia, this is considered valuable.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li class="libasic">Because I am an adult, I manage this by regular discussions with project managers.  They are the correct role to view strategy and tactics without being committed to activities outside my scope.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
