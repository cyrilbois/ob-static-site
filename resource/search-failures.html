<p>I am a software engineer, who has noticeable experience in improving UX and utility of web-based systems.  If I thought this text had any ground breaking ideas, I wouldn't be publishing them on a website, I would be generating a source bundle, then a product and trying to sell the new startup.   This list describes behaviour of search features, and it applies regardless of your implementation technology (eg public website, a mobile app or corporate LAN tooling).</p>

<p>This is a simple list of activities/ interactions/ results that developers can do to isolate and repel consumers; so they cannot buy your products.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > How to fail at search <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Expect consumers to put space characters in, and particular places, and not too many of them. UK postcodes are common failures in this point.</li>
    <li class="libasic">More annoying is when different channels to your organisation have different rules for the same interaction.  For example gmap desktop doesn't mind UK postcodes with no space in the middle; gmap android app will silently drop the second section of the postcode, so report a huge area as a positive match.  Obviously the interaction with the most precision will be via the small handset.</li>
    <li class="libasic">If you have a particular domain for a particular locale; add the code support for that locale. For example the Maltese gmap should understand Maltese postcodes. Otherwise why publish the domain?</li>
    <li class="libasic">Expect consumers to use a particular case (again postcodes).  Yes I saw this on a live site.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Expect users to enter a specific UTF-8 pip to match whatever the [other nationality] sales person put in the DB.  Compare “Salvié’s Cucina” with “Salvie`s Cucina”.  Better displayed as <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/search-text-sample#">search-text-sample</a>.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Expect consumers to learn a graph of product definition rules, and so be able to enter a query language based on them. An anonymous example, is a restaurant marketing company that expected consumers to filter venues based on their own attire when selecting where to eat.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Give consumers a range of different text boxes that each take a different type of id code; and expect consumers to carefully select the input to type into.  Compare Abe books to Amazon [books] for UX.</li>
    <li class="libasic">A good way to get rid of sales is to use annoyingly short pagination, and cram the pages with many adverts, slowing loading time (many examples).  When people view via a phone, most people are happy with scroll; but can't when the adverts make everything freeze, or redraw.</li>
    <li class="libasic">When entering a phone number, obviously the consumer should be responsible for all the prefixes, and entering all of them, in a precise notation.   With a well structured data store, this is not needed; and some data could be guessed with GeoIP.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Statefullness with Angular/React/Vue is all very cool; but make sure it doesn't break and forget the local state. </li>
    <li class="libasic">Paid placement is a good way to increase your revenue; however you also need to respond with what the user asked for.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Guessing things with GeoIP is nice; but if you guess wrong, the consumer needs to be able to correct it.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Have a really poor relevancy algorithm, or maybe none. Therefore the search results are in a random order to consumers desires, like alphabetical.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Make each version of refined search exclusive (i.e. can search by location OR by date but not date and location)</li>
    <li class="libasic">For anything involving time, do not allow any way to separate past events from future events (there aren't many user-stories that confabulate “I went to” and “I would like to go to”). One of the Tate websites does this.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Build a search that is slow (longer than 1s), particularly for small datasets.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I don't know about most peoples biases, but when “popular items” show in search results, I ignore them, as they aren't what I wanted.</li>
    <li class="libasic">In my opinion, don't emphasise the row count, the collection/table size, or the execution time in the UI. Its not relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>My current MD says that 70% of AI (or what seems to be low level automated decision making) is just cleaning and normalising your input data.  Most of these fail cases intersect with this idea.</p>
