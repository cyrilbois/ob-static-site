<p>I would like to migrate my content to a less old platform. I have been putting content into a format that I wrote.  Keeping my content and its format is the most valuable objective.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> Summary of history <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>In 2010, as I couldn't convince the CTO of a number of things including changing to PHP5 was needed, I thought I ought to change employer.  This was my first proper job, I had been working there for six years and helped it grow from a three employee company selling dialup to a nation wide service with millions of customers using DSL.  Delivery of telecoms systems and contracts aren't suited to fast iterations; test coverage is necessary and service availability must be above 99%.  In my last month, I worked extra hours to ensure I left behind documentation for the systems that where managed solely by me.<br />
In 2010, I was less confident with writing things in English, although was better than when I was eighteen. I felt that everyone else on the jobmarket would have PHP5 experience, I had to get some very fast.  I wanted a project I could create during gardening leave which showed I understood what Agile was, and I use current languages, e.g. PHP5.  Now having work experience, the more academic focussed stuff needed to take up less space on my CV.  To meet these objectives, I started a project that had a lot of English, technology last, and was very Agile. You are reading it.  I could have created a wordpress site, at which point I probably would have dropped the project by now, and it would lack PHP5 (Wordpress doesn't really have objects yet, in 2018).  I lacked much claimable experience in visible work, as at mIS I was building B2B<a class="" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=B2B">?</a> XML RPC mostly.  <br />
In total on this project, I think 80% of the time has gone on English prose. Of this, 30% may be pulling references.  In 2013, I reskinned the site to a better layout and colour scheme.  The new layout worked better with the larger amounts of content.  In the middle of 2017 I reskinned it again, mostly dropping code from 2007 era, and updating the CSS for todays CSS (soo much shorter, more stable, less CPU expensive).  In the 2017 update, I added no new features; previously I had been adding one or two UX niceties per year; I compiled/merged the JS and CSS to have less separate assets, so the site is now much faster.  <br />
Like many 'Agile messes', I have been focussing on user-centric design and not technology.  PHP has moved, and by now there is little - if any - value in sole-author whole codebases (an intensional decision for maximal personal experience).  I want to use the newer object features... and have good enough source that people can see it.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc1"> Migration into 2018 <a href="#toc1"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>This site fits “blog” quite closely, although I intentionally have no marketing trackers. The blog market is owned by PHP, Perl was displaced by 2005. There are few large scale blog sites in Node, although it should work really well.  I assume the zeitgeist ignores Node for a reason, and so I wrote a Bridge <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern" target="_blank">1</a></sup> from Symfony3 to my file format <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/icelineDocRender" target="_blank">git</a>.  <br />
In order to deploy my new renderer, as less-old solution, I will need to move to a different webhost. FTP is bad technology in todays world.  Symfony uses many compiled formats, and these are built via command line activities. Yes it is possible to have a “webadmin”, but please see the <b>very long list of security problems with phpMyAdmin and wordpress</b> <sup><a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/09/27/how-to-avoid-being-one-of-the-73-of-wordpress-sites-vulnerable-to-attack/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2631269/how-to-secure-phpmyadmin" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-wordpress-security" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.whitefirdesign.com/blog/2014/12/16/security-vulnerability-fixes-often-left-unmentioned-in-wordpress-plugin-changelogs/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://wordpress.org/about/security/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-security-exploits/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.wordfence.com/learn/how-to-protect-yourself-from-wordpress-security-issues/" target="_blank">9</a></sup>  for why this is a very bad idea.  There is somethings that should not be done “in band”, on the same public HTTP(S) channel.</p>

<p>The obsite <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/jquery-ob1" target="_blank">git</a> project is the last JS/CSS project that I need to have a cleaner codebase.</p>

<p>Actionables:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">locate a new host that is based on VM or something, and allows SSH access</li>
    <li class="libasic">work out the least hassle for moving DNS</li>
    <li class="libasic">add another bundle to the renderer, which is “the site” specific sections</li>
    <li class="libasic">copy wiki files into new bundle</li>
    <li class="libasic">impl all the packaging for the JS &amp; add to new bundle</li>
    <li class="libasic"></li>
