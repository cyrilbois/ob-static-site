<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> Problem <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>It is quite common to want to be able to translate an IP to a location.  To avoid complications with country demarcations, and charsets; it is also common to put this into a [long,lat].  [lat,long] works well with maps.<br />
There are a range of possible outcomes when attempting to compute location.  Obviously LAN IPs have no location. Some IPs aren't registered in mainstream blocks handed to ISPs; so don't show up in records.  Alternatively there may be some “hide me” service, as there is with phone numbers.  On random real usage, mostly from the US, this amounted to about 3% of requests.  There are some IPs which seem to be been logged to ships, oil-rigs or satellites, as they where in the middle of the ocean (this occurred frequently enough that serious use would require a filter).  Obviously care must be taken with rounding numbers, not in the least between language systems.  For <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/visitors#">my use</a>, I rounded everything to 5DP, as I'm not confident in the data below that resolution. I was attempting to demark geo-usage, not individual people.  It should be noted for plain DSL for endusers, the IP is likely to resolve to the DSLAM, as that is where the edge of the internets IP network is (and thus ones public IP).  For example my current personal PC resolves to Skys equipment in WD17, North London.  I was having much better data from business users, who had their own high-use equipment.</p>

<p>Please note Mobile IP is a different set of technology, reporting tools built for the DSL or dialup markets won't work.  Due to the higher levels of tech infrastructure, better quality data is available, but not generally publicly.  The reporting will tell you that your phone is in your current country (the mobile operator is doing all the rest of the traffic routing).  This is not covered in this article.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Everything in this article I state about DSL is too old if the target person is using FTTC.  With FTTC the DSL supplier knows exactly the 'cabinet' you are using is, so places you down to the nearest 10m or so. FTTC is also a faster DSL service.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> Discussion <a href="#toc1"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>There are two general architectures to this concern; firstly get a big database of lookups installed on your server; secondly poll a third party server for each needed lookup.  The first is needed for high performance solutions, but the second is better if the IPs will change mapping frequently.  Assuming it is possible to update the database every-so often, an installed database is a manageable position.</p>

<p>On the work I do, high performance is generally more important (in my scenario, during peaks, it would need to process &gt;5000 requests per minute).  This required that the lookup would take &lt;200ms, or its not possible to process the raw data.  These figures are conservative, but this was one service in an entire platform, and couldn't monopolise resources.  It should be noted that many of the location databases are mostly focussed on a single country, due to boundaries I mentioned previously.  For a global service, I would probably advise using several mapping services.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> Nominated vendor <a href="#toc2"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>Due to operational cost and supporting a US customer base, <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/visitors#">a previous project</a> MT used <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolocate-an-ip?lang=en" target="_blank">Maxminds</a>.  Since I wrote that code, <sup><a href="https://github.com/orgs/maxmind/repositories" target="_blank">1</a></sup> have rebuilt everything for a variety of languages and are using github.  I would advise looking at their newer services.  As some of my usage data was from known sources (we knew who was doing it, and where their office was), I tested the generated location data against  what we knew.  For business users, it was good quality data.  See references to DSLAM throughout this document, its not the lookup software thats the problem.  In Aus ~ where alot of this code was written ~ the nearest city is a good guess. Telephony is more complex here, and there are many more people.<br />
If one needs to verify the mapping, put the generated [lat,long] into google maps.  Please note mapping systems take vertical axis first, due to historical technology.  Graphics systems take the horizontal axis first due to different historical technology.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc3"> Other vendors reviewed <a href="#toc3"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>If I do another system against this technology, I will update this article with more testing and current data.  Please read the caveats expressed in the first paragraph.  Please read the inline results, commercial practice makes this type of analysis imprecise.</p>


<div class="pullout">
<p>With 2012 technology: according to DSL tools my exchange is Kingston (correct at time).  Any up-to-date lookup tools should map my IP to [51.41220,-0.29228].  This isn't the location of my PC, but this is the best this style of lookup can achieve.  This statement is complicated by the fact that my ISP keeps resetting the DSL, and so changing my IP.<br />
With 2023 technology, the <strong>JS feature in the browser</strong> is precise enough for shipping; but not military purposes.</p>

    <li class="libasic"><strong><a href="https://www.geoplugin.com/" target="_blank">Geo Plugin</a> UPDATED 2022: I do not know how this is built; but the data returned is 250mi/ 3degrees too far North wrong.  Also the IP4 data is wildly different from the IP6.</li>
    <li class="libasic"></strong><a href="https://www.hostip.info/" target="_blank">Host IP</a> is a community project<strong>, with links to commercial vendors.  At present they are unable to resolve my personal desktop IP. They quote fast response times, and do provide a sensible/ lean API for lookups.  As this is non commercial, they have a static downloadable database; and suggest daily refresh on this.  I would be interested in what their update policies where (i.e. what if the assignment of an IP changes, how long would the customer get out of date information?), before I started to depend on them.  UPDATE 2023: everything written still holds.</li>
    <li class="libasic"></strong><a href="https://www.ip2location.com/" target="_blank">ip2location</a> is a rented service, with a freemuim offering<strong>.  They map my DSL to Charing Cross. Due to commercial practice this could be true, but can't be true at the same time as maxminds response.  This is a static file.  The packing algorithm is less efficient than what maxmind uses, as this data is about ten times larger.</li>
    <li class="libasic"></strong><a href="https://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator/" target="_blank">geobytes</a> charge a small amount per lookup<strong>.  This doesn't work for me, with either IP.   Many adverts intruding on website.</li>

<p><strong> In a normal (HTML5) browser, you can lookup this up (takes 3s for me): </strong></p>


<span id="location"> Nothing is set yet (Firefox/linux doesn't like this feature).</span>
<div class="pullout">
<p>It would be a clever idea to use the JS geo location to allow less required input on address forms.   And now this is reliable, its quite common.</p>
