<p>Previously I was writing purely on my software engineering background.  This and some related resources are mentioning some of the project focussed stuff.  In terms of the “my own project”/ practice this seems the same as writing websites for charities.  Everything that I effected in terms of process at mIS is fairly industry standard, and behind an NDA.<br />
This text makes me sound very organised, and with a top-down world-view.  Focussing on preparation for WGT specifically (largest single item), I was at a party in September 2009, and defined my goals in one night.  To implement my plan took a year.</p>

<p>As a challenge, and to have a better understanding of music, I decided to go to six music festivals, across the musical genre; in one year.  The count is entirely arbitrary; but is a balance of occurrence vs ability to spend on each (aka quality).  For example, if I was attempting a higher number, I would have needed to abandon WGT, as flights and hotels are large item expenditure.   Being at a festival takes time to setup and breakdown; time to do these activities needs to be factored in (i.e. travelling two successive weekends means you perform badly at work).  <br />
In the preceding two years I had been increasing my contact and development in graphic arts, this balanced my immersion.  As I have invested in tools to create art and sewing, I have no investment in making music.  Being able to understand it is useful.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> Outcomes <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Much better understanding on composition for music (how it is built, rather than how it makes you feel);</li>
    <li>An understanding of the music festival market, demographics, and business process;</li>
    <li>A good comparative analysis of music genres ~ this is hard when you go clubbing to socialise, and frequently ignore the music;</li>
</ol>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> Process <a href="#toc1"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Structure entire year towards this project.  Organise with employer carefully, so my rate of achievements didn't drop;  </li>
    <li>Spend time at the end of the preceding year to investigate the subject;</li>
    <li>Build social networking towards this objective, exchange lots of festival news; </li>
    <li>Investigate a range of transport options, to be able to arrive all over England, and international travel.  Leverage long purchase lead-times and flexibility to achieve cheap rates;</li>
    <li>Invest time and learning to being able to talk in German, know more German culture, understand the way Germany is built (Die BahnHof for example);</li>
    <li>Think, structure and manage luggage.  Organise containerised storage, same as international shipping.</li>
    <li>To appear correctly attired (and dressed relevant to continuous activities), use lead-times and the pre-owned markets to achieve more than I could afford to spend.  This process changed the entire subculture of my clothes;</li>
</ol>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> Project Management <a href="#toc2"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ol>
    <li>The first step was an upgrade to my telecoms, to allow efficient communications for any of the activities (my existing PC was old and underspecified);</li>
    <li>Perform previously stated domain knowledge developments;</li>
    <li>Spend time over the Xmas break planning a Gantt for the entire year;<ol>
        <li>This included sliding windows in which finance all individual objectives (as obviously I needed to pay my normal bills);</li>
        <li>Due to an actual schedule, and fund projections; leave project without debt;</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>As practice runs, start going clubbing in London (this using much of the same process);</li>
    <li>Transport had to be purchased over the course of the year, as many transport companies will not let you book tickets with a 9month lead time. Manage this process;</li>
    <li>Practice the actual pack and unpack of my luggage, to reduce the time this took. Improve my long term storage to facilitate this;</li>
    <li>Start using an ad-hoc inventory system to ensure I could organise all of my fairly complex costumes, in a small space, and quick setup/ breakdown.  This requires storage for travel, and secondly storage at the destination;</li>
    <li>My highly organised approach to travel, flight restrictions etc, means I generally have little problem at airports or stations.  This will be a lot less labour intensive when I have a portable information device (e.g. ipad);</li>
    <li>I believe the entire project embodies efficiency and pragmatism, which is the goal of good PM;</li>
