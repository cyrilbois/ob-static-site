<p>Dear reader,<br />
I am an experienced software engineer, who is going back to typed languages as it often saves time.  I have a focus on UX to increase product fit.   I live in London, UK; I believe I meet your requirements as:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">My most recent project was to develop a B2C mobile app for social sharing.   I have built and extended other B2B apps previously.  This one  was in Typescript and Reactnative; but I think my most important outcome was designing user journeys.  In practical steps, I created many React components, and two new API.  I was building an app to be run with haptic input; and communicate more clearly; the initial people where focussing on Reactnative itself too much.  I read the spec for Kotlin, but can't claim commercial use of it.</li>
    <li class="libasic">With regards to “low touch, high volume”; I improved business automation at murphx, Venue10, and Hoptroff.  I developed many tools at murphx, and automated entire business cycles.  They had about one technical person per 50,000 customers, which I'm told is below average staffing for an ISP.  I could do much better these days, as I have more experience with many tools and platforms in the last decade.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Nearly all my experience is in startups (which is why I mention so many languages).   I have added testing suites to many products, including ones I didn't start.  I have managed interns, and been a 'senior peer' to other developers.  I am a reasonable software architect; but favour fast iterations until requirements are well understood as a higher priority.   </li>
    <li class="libasic">I have worked with Kanban previously; and worked for a Scrum-master at Matatiro Solutions.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I have been a “mostly front-end developer” for now eight years.   I have used React for three products; and also used Vue and Angular.   I chose my last role, Swyvl, to get some Typescript experience, I think it improves Javascript stability (mostly on big projects, like that which Microsoft develops).  I have a second OSS project in Typescript, which hopefully will be complete enough to show you.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">I have a wide range of experience in databases systems; I have used Postgres on four products.  I was using TypeORM at Swyvl to get data from an AWS RDS service; I massively extended a simple Node-based app at Venue10 which used Mongoose ORM.  Due to my age, I started writing software before ORMs were common in website languages; and can use SQL directly for everything complex (it is a typeful and declarative language, which can be used in a functional fashion).   </li>
    <li class="libasic">I have six years previous experience in telecoms as an industry at murphx.   The technology will be completely different; but the user journeys and transferable skills are in the business processes.   I built many telephony systems, the most relevant ones are: in 2008, I built a commercial version of Asterisk project, to their specific needs with respect to behaviour (in C).   I also created murphx's telephony integration with Salesforce (via PHP).  </li>
    <li class="libasic">I have built Node tools in three products.  I have many years experience building REST API in other languages.   I have built a project in golang at Hoptroff; as that company will be building everything in Golang in the future.  I have integrated SMS and email features multiple times (including Twilio).  I have integrated with facebook and google for authentication at Swyvl; I made the UI much nicer than the default settings and remember users' preferences and habits. </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon,<br />
Owen Beresford</p>
