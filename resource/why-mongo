<p>About the author: I claim I am a software engineer, but increasing feel the most important aspect is librarianship. What I hope you to gain from reading these articles is to provide an actual list of reasons to use or not use a NoSQL system.  There are too many articles on the web that assume technical skills below GCSE level. Articulate and concise writing to record a conversation assists all later work.  Updating all the internal data assets will ensure they are useful. Getting accurate requirements will make a project succeed or fail. <em>The words that you are reading are rendered by a documentation library <sup><a href="http://pear.php.net/Text_Wiki" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, controlled by a documentation system <sup><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iceline/?source=directory" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, run on a protocol <sup><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> originally designed for academic documentation <sup><a href="http://www.omicsonline.org/peer-reviewed-journals.php" target="_blank">4</a></sup>. This cluster of articles is about a documentation system <sup><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.  A human-to-human asynchronous communication to ensure that ideas are communicated.</em></p>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> The answer to “Why MongoDB?&quot; is “because of documentation”. <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>The wider question being: “why NoSQL?&quot;, but MongoDB is a good concrete example.  RDBMS are an established solution to managing and reporting volumes of data on slow hardware, needing access restrictions. This is an introduction to the concept of nosql db and for a couple of later articles (see links at end).</p>

<p>The operational platform for information systems is about 10^3 times faster than in the 1970s [ <a href="http://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/why-mongo#note1" target="_blank">1</a> ]. Firstly, we have new faster hardware so why do we need architecture like the sql system from 50’s – 70’s? In fact SQL works better with faster hardware. A byte of storage cost around 1p back then. Today the cost of storage has dropped by a factor of 3: it just means that today you optimise different dimensions. Strict control on data structures and types is less important, when one quotes “computer operations per second” in 10^9 and human operations per second ~ unchanged since the 1970s ~ at about 10^-2 (e.g. 1 thing per 100seconds ).  Structuring concepts in mutable 'documents' rather than normalised 'entities' achieves a functional solution faster. Computing now is different to what it was then. If your data looks like a document i.e a big blob of data that you can access via a single key; in this case this is the advantage of mongoDB: it is more efficient. If data looks like excel, then sql is more efficient.</p>

<p>Systems like Mongo are important, as they represent todays data and operating conditions. The second reason for NoSQL is map-reduce operations.  That is parallelised crunching operations on &gt;10GB datasets to show trends.  Via NoSQL this is much faster to build than RDBMS; and as RDBMS aren't generally parallelised nor faster performing.</p>

<p>The amount of data we record is at least 10^3 larger than the 1970s, and we expect to be able to access any/all of it quickly.  MongoDB as a data storage was introduced in 2010 <sup><a href="http://technosophos.com/content/mongodb-5-things-every-php-developer-should-know-about-mongodb" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.  It was designed as document storage system and for collections of documents. Short for ‘humongous’, it is an open source product and the architecture is different for data storage; going from rigid tables to documents.  This closely matches the concepts I have been working with for the last decade, this is why I write about it.</p>

<p>Taking <sup><a href="http://www.nathandavison.com/posts/view/12/php-sessions-stored-in-a-mongo-database" target="_blank">2</a></sup> as an example; your entire infrastructure is supposed to be ported to NoSQL.  My earlier reading held that NoSQL was very good at certain things, but as RDBMS were established with a large tool set, they where more efficient.</p>

<p>Lastly I note the revision to the licence.  As licences are supposed to reflect and restrict the social role of the systems use; the changing world requires their update.  From now on, everything should be marked with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" target="_blank">agpl</a>, until they publish the next one (there is a positional omission, which they have yet to resolve).</p>

<a name="note1"> [1]</a> This is rough data.  The use of computing has changed alot in the last fifty years, and the scale of the business is vastly larger.  As such its an apples to oranges comparison on what you use for reference figures.  I spent 10m pulling a average machine stat from 1970, and then a recent 1u rack box.  The numbers are about 10^3 larger in all cases, other than physical size, cost and power consumption.  Even naive analysis must include effects of caching and parallel hardware/ multiple cores.
