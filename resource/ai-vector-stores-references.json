During operation, the system receives a set of objects to be stored in the parallel hybrid spill tree. The system selects a subset of objects from the set of objects, and then uses this subset to create a &ldquo;top tree.&rdquo; Each node in the top tree defines an associated partition for the parallel hybrid, spill tree.
