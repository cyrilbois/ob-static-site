<p>I am an experienced software engineer, and have built things with JS and TS depending on scale.  I have used a wide range of JS frameworks; but can also write in raw JS.  In 2022, I am refitting this article; I need to update this every three years at the slowest.  My experience as a JS and TS based developer is:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>All my code is “use strict”.  Due to writing in other languages before JS, I rarely hoist;</li>
    <li>I generally write JS to ES2020 level; previously I used older editions.   I am tracking the “current stable” version for TS, and currently have v4.something installed (I check this with every new project).  As of 2021 I am joyously deleting all the es5shim import statements, as MSIE has been retired by Microsoft.  The current browser that needs the most compatibility support is Safari;</li>
    <li>I went to a JS conference in 2020, see <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/js-nation-live-notes#">notes</a>, ands also a second <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/guardian-masterclass-notes#">datavis one</a> ~ 2021;</li>
    <li>I have used Typescript at Swyvl, and for open source.  I think the type system in Golang is better; but I see the commercial value in using typescript for projects, in the browser or a server side API;</li>
    <li>I have used Node commercially, starting in 2015.  For the first project, I updated the version of Node and I was extending the functionality, the first version was built with Mongoose and Express.  That project also used handlebars, and the JS templating library (bra/pug) <a href="https://koajs.com/" target="_blank">Koa</a> would be a better framework IMO; as generators lead to less nested callbacks, and secondly it has less of a maze of extensions;</li>
    <li>If I was starting a fresh project, I would look at Deno for serverside JS; as it's easier to manage deps;</li>
    <li>I have used <b>React</b> to build three products (this took about three years, one was small), with v16, and v17 (across <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/UX-engineer#">UX-engineer</a> and <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/reactnative-developer#">reactnative-developer</a> ).  This consumed about three years (one was small), and I have built OSS with v18.  I spent 18 months using <b>Vue2</b> to make a product (also Hoptroff); and used Vue3 for recent OSS.  I worked for over a year on a product using <b>Angularjs</b> at <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/lead-engineer#">lead-engineer</a>;</li>
    <li>I generally build PWA, and carefully monitor browser support for various features.   As most people would aggregate UX with client side work, I refer to some case studies <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/usability-casestudy-01#">UX</a> and <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/usability-casestudy-02#">more UX</a>, and <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/reactnative-developer#">third</a>.</li>
    <li>I prefer to write in objects/modules, it makes testing much easier and cheaper.  I can write code towards OO or towards FP architectural styles.   Unless I am rushed, I extract Services from Components to make testing easier/ faster;</li>
    <li>I use a range of test tools. I currently target testing via <b>Jest</b>, <b>Vitest</b> and <b>Storybook</b>.  See <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/storybook#">storybook</a> and <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/vitest#">vitest</a> for more details.   Historically I used <b>Mocha/Chai</b> for example <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/es6-test-demo" target="_blank">a demo</a>, and <b><a href="https://qunitjs.com/" target="_blank">qunit</a></b>.  I have used Cypress abit (Swyvl).  Before I was aware of Storybook, I made a simple <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/ux-verify#">ux-verify</a> library to plug into Mocha, Jest or Jasmine tests;</li>
    <li>I recently updated my practice for documenting JS/TS code, please see <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/docs-for-js-ts#">docs-for-js-ts</a>, with a sample in a <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/CatProfileDemo" target="_blank">repo</a></li>
    <li>My libraries tidily don't pollute the symbolspace anymore than is necessary.  With modern “modules” JS, I get a closure for free, and do not need to wrap my code in one anymore.  I know what the self executing function declarations are, but generally only use them in jQuery;</li>
    <li>Focussing on reports, I really like datepickers; as it removes two days off any isolated platform development.  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Unless I am doing something complex with date ranges, I am now using plain HTML5.  Previously when I needed to support MSIE, I normally used a JS date picker and a clock picker;</li>
    <li>As with most people, I have built SPA.  For current technology, I would be using a JS templating and content injection tools, for example React + Redux.   Making HTML on the server side in a non-JS language is typically faster executing.   </li>
    <li>General consensus is that data manipulation should be on the server, so it can't be disabled;</li>
    <li>I have worked in high volume services/sites, but the most scalable server languages aren't JS.  When I was extending Venue10's systems I added the service monitoring features, and service availability tweaks, to make it a more useful and regulated service.  At Hoptroff there was a devop; but I contributed scripts for his tooling, and database audit scripts, which made more impact.  At Swyvl, I improved uptime, improved performance, added tests, added monitoring to the Typescript based product.   </li>
    <li>I have done some demo code with websockets, but as fundamentally its a TCP socket, this is no different to normal POSIX programming.  I have written alot of normal TCP and UDP based programming;</li>
    <li>With regards to UI, I target HTML5, mobile and RWD/ PWA.  I use CSS frameworks for cost reasons.  My personal site is targeting desktop mostly, due to the volume of words; but there is CSS for mobile;  </li>
    <li> .</li>
    <li>The following are JS heavy projects:<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/reactnative-developer#">reactnative-developer</a> ~ most recent</li>
